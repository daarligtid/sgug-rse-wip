SGUG RPM Software Environment - Work In Progress Packages

## Licensing

It is intended that any fedora `.spec` files listed here are under the "Fedora Project Contributor Agreement": https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Fedora_Project_Contributor_Agreement.

Notably - fedora specifically mentions spec file licensing here: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main#License_of_Fedora_SPEC_Files

Unless otherwise stated, those `.spec` files remain under their original license as per their contribution to Fedora. This project does not attempt to supplant nor change the license of these works.

The modifications from the original fedora `.spec` files fall under the license of the sgug-rse project, namely GPL3.

## What is this?

This is a place that un-vetted and potentially all kinds of broken builds of packages can be checked in without needing the "full" `.spec` treatment.

Everything here is unsupported and considered unreleased - but can be useful as a collaborative place to get stuff working.

Have at it.
